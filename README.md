myUsask
=======

myUsask is a project I built for my portfolio in 2011. It scrapes data from paws.usask.ca, a website where U of S students can login to read their emails, view classes, etc. This is the iOS version of the app; there is a separate repo for the Android version. It was never intended for real world use however and many parts of it no longer work because of data changes on the PAWS website.
